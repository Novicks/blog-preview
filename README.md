## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned better ways to center elements, using margin 0 auto and place-content, and when using percentages and vw for responsive development. In addition to having worked on this project using the mobile first methodology, which was very pleasant and better for developing the application in my opinion. Thanks to the user Marcos Travaglini who gave me the tip of using place-content.eplace with your own learnings.\*\*

### Continued development

Next objective is to use frameworks like react and tailwind to develop solutions.
